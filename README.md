# UART Camera
Reference for how to operate a Serial port on alternate serial pins. Thanks to `ATSAMD21`'s awesome configurable `SERCOM`.
Eventually, we can add a cellular radio (like `FONA 808`) on `Serial1` and have a cameraphone!

Much of this is copypasta from https://learn.adafruit.com/using-atsamd21-sercom-to-add-more-spi-i2c-serial-ports and https://learn.adafruit.com/ttl-serial-camera/
